expressive tts that can clone any voice

- open training code and onnx model
- much faster than realtime on cpu & gpu
- emotive, built for characters

## get started

### install + quick test (2 lines)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smallbraineng/smalltts && cd smalltts
uv run python scripts/tryme.py "Hello from smallTTS!"
```

uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for setup.

### interactive (realtime on cpu)

```bash
uv run python scripts/infer/interactive.py
```

### install as a package

```bash
uv pip install "git+https://github.com/smallbraineng/smalltts"
```

```python
from smalltts import SmallTTS
tts = SmallTTS()
```

### more examples

#### batch inference

```bash
uv run python scripts/infer/batch.py
```

#### voice cloning

```bash
uv run python scripts/infer/clone.py \
  --wav assets/test_audio/1.wav \
  --transcription "the reference transcription here" \
  --text "what you want it to say"
```

## benchmarks

| hardware | batch | RTF | runtime |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| nvidia t4 | 1 | 0.02 | onnx + cuda |
| nvidia t4 | 16 | 0.004 | onnx + cuda |

checkpoints live on huggingface: [smallbraineng/smalltts](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts).

### checkpoints

| name | download |
| --- | --- |
| teacher_checkpoints | [assets/teacher_checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/teacher_checkpoints) |
| dmd_checkpoints | [assets/dmd_checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/dmd_checkpoints) |
| asr_checkpoints | [assets/asr_checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/asr_checkpoints) |
| sv_checkpoints | [assets/sv_checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/sv_checkpoints) |

from-scratch training order, in `scripts/train`:
1. teacher model (128 steps): `uv run accelerate launch scripts/train/teacher.py`
2. dmd2 distillation (4 steps): `uv run accelerate launch scripts/train/dmd2/distill.py`
3. speaker verification: `uv run accelerate launch scripts/train/dmd2/sv.py`
4. asr: `uv run accelerate launch scripts/train/dmd2/asr.py`

### method
- teacher is a diffusion tts model generating audio in 128 sampling steps
- we train on encoded latents, not audio/mels. [microsoft vibevoice](https://github.com/microsoft/VibeVoice) encoder/decoder gives ~3200x compression
- we distill to 4 steps with distribution matching distillation ([dmd2 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14867))
- inspired by [dmdspeech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11097) and [dmospeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14988)
- during distillation we train an asr and a speaker verification model to keep phonemes and style aligned

### data
- the default dataloader is dummy. bring your own
- we have tested [webdataset](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset)
- checkpoints on huggingface make fine‑tuning easy

## inference

use onnx exports for production inference, download from huggingface, see `infer/` for examples

| model | download |
| --- | --- |
| end‑to‑end model | [assets/e2e](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/e2e) |
| length predictor | [assets/length](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/length) |
| codec (encoder/decoder) | [assets/codec](https://huggingface.co/smallbraineng/smalltts/tree/main/assets/codec) |

see `src/smalltts/infer/onnx.py` for the simplest api, or just use the scripts above.

## roadmap

- [x] **09.09.25** 🚀 v0 released, model and ONNX exports on 🤗 Hugging Face
- [ ] 📱 quantized version & mobile example
- [ ] 🏋️‍♂️ larger training run

## licenses

code is licensed under CC-BY-NC. see [LICENSE](LICENSE).

model weights on huggingface are licensed CC‑BY‑NA.

## next steps

1. quantized builds and realtime mobile demo
2. full version with stability upgrades
